# üè° Airbnb Clone 

## üìò Project Overview

This is the backend system for an Airbnb Clone project. It provides all the behind-the-scenes logic that powers the core features of a property rental platform; like creating listings, booking stays, making payments, and managing users. The goal is to make sure everything works efficiently and securely so that users and hosts have a smooth experience.

## üéØ Project Goals

- **User Management**: Let people sign up, log in, and manage their personal information.
- **Property Management**: Allow hosts to create, update, and delete property listings.
- **Booking System**: Let users reserve listings, track bookings, and manage check-in/out.
- **Payment Processing**: Safely handle transactions for property bookings.
- **Review System**: Users can provide feedback and rate their stays.
- **Database Optimization**: Optimize queries and data flow for performance and scalability.

## üß† Team Roles and Responsibilities

Each team member plays a critical role in delivering a seamless backend:

- **Backend Developer**  
  Builds and maintains the API endpoints, writes business logic, and ensures the integration of all core features (authentication, bookings, payments, etc.).

- **Database Administrator (DBA)**  
  Designs the database schema, ensures relational integrity, handles indexing, optimizes queries, and manages backups and recovery.

- **DevOps Engineer**  
  Manages deployment pipelines, containerization (Docker), infrastructure monitoring, and ensures the backend scales reliably.

- **QA Engineer**  
  Designs and runs test cases, conducts regression and performance testing, and ensures all backend functionalities work as intended.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technology Stack

| Technology      | Purpose |
|----------------|---------|
| **Django** | A web framework that makes it easier to build and organize the backend logic of your app. |
| **Django REST Framework (DRF)** | An extension of Django that helps you create APIs quickly and efficiently. |
| **PostgreSQL** | A powerful relational database that stores your data ‚Äî like users, bookings, and reviews. |
| **GraphQL** | A query language that gives more control over the data you fetch from the backend. It helps reduce the amount of data sent to the frontend. |
| **Celery** | A tool for handling background tasks ‚Äî like sending emails or processing long-running jobs ‚Äî without slowing down the main app. |
| **Redis** | A fast, in-memory data store used mainly for caching data and managing background job queues (used with Celery). |
| **Docker** | Packages your entire app and its dependencies into a container so it can run reliably on any machine. |
| **CI/CD Pipelines (like GitHub Actions)** | Automates the process of testing, building, and deploying your code every time you make changes. |

## üóÉÔ∏è Database Design

### Key Entities and Fields

1. **Users**
   - `id`: Unique identifier
   - `email`: User's email (used for login)
   - `password`: Encrypted password
   - `full_name`: User's name
   - `is_host`: Boolean flag indicating if the user can list properties

2. **Properties**
   - `id`: Unique identifier
   - `title`: Property name/title
   - `description`: Detailed description
   - `location`: Address or city
   - `price_per_night`: Cost of staying per night

3. **Bookings**
   - `id`: Unique identifier
   - `user_id`: Foreign key to User
   - `property_id`: Foreign key to Property
   - `check_in`: Date of check-in
   - `check_out`: Date of check-out

4. **Payments**
   - `id`: Unique identifier
   - `booking_id`: Foreign key to Booking
   - `amount`: Transaction amount
   - `status`: Payment status (e.g., success, failed)
   - `timestamp`: Date and time of transaction

5. **Reviews**
   - `id`: Unique identifier
   - `user_id`: Foreign key to User
   - `property_id`: Foreign key to Property
   - `rating`: Star rating (1‚Äì5)
   - `comment`: User's feedback

### Entity Relationships

- A **User** can have multiple **Properties** (if they are a host).
- A **User** can make multiple **Bookings**.
- A **Booking** is linked to one **Property** and one **User**.
- A **Payment** is tied to a **Booking**.
- A **Review** is written by a **User** for a **Property**.

## üß© Feature Breakdown

1. **User Management**  
   Allows users to register, log in, and manage their profiles securely. Authentication and authorization ensure user data is protected.

2. **Property Management**  
   Hosts can list, update, or delete properties. Each property includes descriptions, prices, and location details.

3. **Booking System**  
   Users can view availability, make reservations, and manage existing bookings. The system tracks check-in and check-out dates.

4. **Payment Processing**  
   Secure handling of financial transactions for property reservations, integrated with external payment providers.

5. **Review System**  
   Lets users rate and review properties, helping improve trust and transparency within the platform.

6. **API Documentation**  
   REST and GraphQL APIs are documented using OpenAPI, aiding both frontend integration and third-party development.

## üîê API Security

### Security Measures

- **Authentication**: Users must log in using secure credentials (likely via token-based auth like JWT).
- **Authorization**: Access control ensures users can only manage their own resources.
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents abuse of APIs by limiting requests per user/IP.
- **Data Validation**: Ensures only clean, safe input is processed.
- **HTTPS**: All traffic should be encrypted in production.

### Importance

- **User Data Protection**: Prevents unauthorized access to sensitive info.
- **Secure Payments**: Ensures transactional data and processes are safe from tampering.
- **System Integrity**: Defends against DDoS attacks, brute force, and malicious data input.

## üöÄ CI/CD Pipeline

### What is CI/CD?

CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment. It‚Äôs a way of automatically testing and deploying your code every time you push changes to the repository.

**Why it matters:**  
It reduces the chance of bugs, speeds up development, and ensures your updates are safely and consistently released.

**Tools Used:**  
- **GitHub Actions**: Automates tasks like testing your code and deploying it when changes are made.
- **Docker**: Ensures that your app works the same way on any machine, making deployments smoother.
- **Celery & Redis**: Handle background tasks in production without blocking the main app.


- **GitHub Actions**: Automates your workflow for pushing changes, testing, and deploying.
- **Docker**: Standardizes the environment for consistent builds and deployments.
- **Celery & Redis**: Handles background tasks and queue management in a non-blocking, efficient way.

CI/CD ensures that every new feature or bug fix is tested, reviewed, and deployed quickly and reliably.
